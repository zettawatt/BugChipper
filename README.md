BugChipper
==========

A bug tracking system written in Java and utilizing MySQL for its database.

This project is in the very early stages. Currently, it brings up a Java
Swing GUI with buttons that mostly do nothing but print to a log. This is my
first Java program and first time playing with MySQL, so it is taking me longer
than if it were written in Perl :)

In the end, this bug tracking software will be unique in that it will allow for
cross linking of bugs. Its primary purpose is to handle hundreds of projects
utilizing thousands of shared components. Bugs will be added to a component
and all projects with the component will have a new bug attached to them
and will notify their respective developer. I have not found a bug tracking
system (that is free) that will do this easily.

I also wanted a standalone GUI that did not require an apache server to run,
only a MySQL database.

So for now, this does nothing useful. It is getting there, slowly but surely...
